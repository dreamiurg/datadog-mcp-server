## Why This One?

Look, we get it. You searched "datadog mcp server" and got seven results. You're wondering which one to pick. Let us save you approximately forty-five seconds of reading other READMEs that say "supports monitors and dashboards" like that's supposed to impress someone.

We're not saying the other MCP servers are bad. That would be rude, and also legally questionable. They're all built by talented engineers who are contributing to open source and making the ecosystem better. Some of them have features we don't, like the ability to *write* to your Datadog account from an AI chat window. We chose not to include those. On purpose. You're welcome.

### The Philosophy

**Read everything. Write nothing.**

Your AI assistant should be able to *see* all of Datadog. It should *not* be able to silence your pager at 3 AM because it decided your alerts were "probably fine." That's not a hypothetical scenario. That's a Tuesday. We have opinions about this, and they are all correct.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx github:dreamiurg/datadog-mcp --help
```

**That's it.** No installation required. Node.js 20+. Works in 8 seconds. We timed it.

## Setup

### 1. Get Datadog Credentials

You need two keys from your [Datadog Organization Settings](https://app.datadoghq.com/organization-settings/):

| Credential | Where to Find | Difficulty |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| **API Key** | Organization Settings -> API Keys -> New Key | Easy |
| **Application Key** | Organization Settings -> Application Keys -> New Key | Also easy |

> **Tip:** For least-privilege access, [scope your Application Key](#application-key-scopes) to only the permissions you need. Or give it everything. We won't judge. (We will judge a little.)

### 2. Configure Your AI Tool

## The Competitive Landscape (We Did the Research So You Don't Have To)

There are approximately seven thousand Datadog MCP servers on GitHub. We counted. Then we lost count. Then we counted again. Here's how they stack up:

| Capability | **Us** | Project 1 | Project 2 | Project 3 | Project 4 |
|-----------|:------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|:---------:|
| Total tools | **116** | ~20 | ~10 | ~13 | ~29 |
| Read-only by design | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | No |
| Can mute your hosts | No | **Yes** | No | No | No |
| Can delete your dashboards | No | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Can schedule downtimes | No | **Yes** | No | No | **Yes** |
| Test suite | 570 tests | - | - | - | - |
| Last meaningful update | Today | Recent | Dec 2025 | Jan 2026 | Dec 2025 |

> **A note on write operations:** Some servers let your AI create monitors, delete dashboards, and schedule downtimes. That's a feature. It's also the plot of every "AI gone wrong" movie ever made. We chose the boring path: read everything, touch nothing. Our therapist says this is healthy.

### What They Have That We Don't

In the interest of full transparency (and because our lawyers said we had to):

- Some servers can mute/unmute hosts and schedule downtimes (write operations we intentionally excluded because we enjoy sleeping)
- Some servers can CRUD monitors and dashboards (see above re: AI movies, and also re: sleeping)
- Some servers have unique metric field exploration tools

We sleep *extremely* well at night.

<summary><strong>403 Forbidden</strong></summary>

1. Verify API key and Application key are correct
2. Check your Application Key has required [scopes](#application-key-scopes)
3. Confirm you're using the correct [regional endpoint](#regional-endpoints)

cd datadog-mcp
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript |
| `npm test` | Run tests (570 tests in 120 files) |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run tests with coverage (90%+ enforced) |
| `npm run lint` | Run Biome linter |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type check |
| `npm run complexity` | Check cyclomatic complexity |
| `npm run ci` | Run everything (the full gauntlet) |

### Test with MCP Inspector

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js \
  --apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY \
  --appKey=YOUR_APP_KEY

## Disclaimer

**In case it wasn't abundantly, blindingly, neon-sign-in-the-desert obvious:** the comparison tables above are written with tongue so firmly in cheek it's coming out the other side. This is sarcasm. We are being sarcastic. If you're still not sure, yes, that was also sarcasm.

Every single Datadog MCP server out there was built by engineers who cared enough to ship something real into the world. That's more than most people do on a Saturday. Open source is better when there are options, and the ecosystem is better because all of these projects exist.

If our 116 read-only tools aren't what you need, genuinely and sincerely: go find the one that is. Try them all. Mix and match. Build your own. Fork ours and add write operations if you're feeling brave (and have good backups). The best tool is the one that fits your workflow, not the one with the spiciest README.

Now go build something great. Sleep tight.
