We're not saying the other MCP servers are bad. They're lovely. Some of them have features we don't, like the ability to *mute your production hosts* and *schedule downtimes* from an AI chat window. We chose not to include those. On purpose. You're welcome.

### The Philosophy

**Read everything. Write nothing.**

Your AI assistant should be able to *see* all of Datadog. It should *not* be able to silence your pager at 3 AM because it decided your alerts were "probably fine." We have opinions about this.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
npx github:dreamiurg/datadog-mcp-server --help
```

**That's it.** No installation required. Node.js 20+. Works in 8 seconds. We timed it.

---

## Setup

### 1. Get Datadog Credentials

You need two keys from your [Datadog Organization Settings](https://app.datadoghq.com/organization-settings/):

| Credential | Where to Find | Difficulty |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| **API Key** | Organization Settings -> API Keys -> New Key | Easy |
| **Application Key** | Organization Settings -> Application Keys -> New Key | Also easy |

> **Tip:** For least-privilege access, [scope your Application Key](#application-key-scopes) to only the permissions you need. Or give it everything. We won't judge. (We will judge a little.)

### 2. Configure Your AI Tool

## The Competitive Landscape (We Did the Research So You Don't Have To)

There are approximately seven thousand Datadog MCP servers on GitHub. Here's how they stack up:

| Capability | **Us** | winor30 | GeLi2001 | shelfio | ppandrangi |
|-----------|:------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|:---------:|
| Total tools | **108** | 20 | 10 | 13 | 29 |
| Read-only by design | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | No |
| Can mute your hosts | No | **Yes** | No | No | No |
| Can delete your dashboards | No | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Can schedule downtimes | No | **Yes** | No | No | **Yes** |
| Test suite | 480 tests | - | - | - | - |
| Last meaningful update | Today | Recent | Dec 2025 | Jan 2026 | Dec 2025 |

> **A note on write operations:** Some competitors let your AI create monitors, delete dashboards, and schedule downtimes. That's a feature. It's also the plot of every "AI gone wrong" movie. We chose the boring path: read everything, touch nothing.

### What They Have That We Don't

In the interest of full transparency:

- **winor30** can mute/unmute hosts and schedule downtimes (write operations we intentionally excluded)
- **ppandrangi** can CRUD monitors and dashboards (see above re: AI movies)
- **shelfio** has some unique metric field exploration tools

We sleep well at night.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>403 Forbidden</strong></summary>

1. Verify API key and Application key are correct
2. Check your Application Key has required [scopes](#application-key-scopes)
3. Confirm you're using the correct [regional endpoint](#regional-endpoints)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Connection Issues</strong></summary>

```bash
# Check MCP server status
claude mcp list

# View logs (Claude Desktop - macOS)
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log

# View logs (Claude Desktop - Windows)
Get-Content "$env:APPDATA\Claude\Logs\mcp*.log" -Tail 20 -Wait
