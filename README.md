## Why This One?

Look, we get it. You searched "datadog mcp server" and got seven results. You're wondering which one to pick. Let us save you some time.

We're not saying the other MCP servers are bad. They're lovely. Some of them have features we don't, like the ability to *mute your production hosts* and *schedule downtimes* from an AI chat window. We chose not to include those. On purpose. You're welcome.

### The Philosophy

**Read everything. Write nothing.**

Your AI assistant should be able to *see* all of Datadog. It should *not* be able to silence your pager at 3 AM because it decided your alerts were "probably fine." We have opinions about this.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
npx github:dreamiurg/datadog-mcp-server --help
```

**That's it.** No installation required. Node.js 20+. Works in 8 seconds. We timed it.

---

## Setup

### 1. Get Datadog Credentials

You need two keys from your [Datadog Organization Settings](https://app.datadoghq.com/organization-settings/):

| Credential | Where to Find | Difficulty |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| **API Key** | Organization Settings -> API Keys -> New Key | Easy |
| **Application Key** | Organization Settings -> Application Keys -> New Key | Also easy |

> **Tip:** For least-privilege access, [scope your Application Key](#application-key-scopes) to only the permissions you need. Or give it everything. We won't judge. (We will judge a little.)

### 2. Configure Your AI Tool

## The Competitive Landscape (We Did the Research So You Don't Have To)

There are approximately seven thousand Datadog MCP servers on GitHub. Here's how they stack up:

| Capability | **Us** | winor30 | GeLi2001 | shelfio | ppandrangi |
|-----------|:------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|:---------:|
| Total tools | **48** | 20 | 10 | 13 | 29 |
| Read-only by design | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | No |
| Can mute your hosts | No | **Yes** | No | No | No |
| Can delete your dashboards | No | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Can schedule downtimes | No | **Yes** | No | No | **Yes** |
| Test suite | 219 tests | - | - | - | - |
| Last meaningful update | Today | Recent | Dec 2025 | Jan 2026 | Dec 2025 |

> **A note on write operations:** Some competitors let your AI create monitors, delete dashboards, and schedule downtimes. That's a feature. It's also the plot of every "AI gone wrong" movie. We chose the boring path: read everything, touch nothing.

### What They Have That We Don't

In the interest of full transparency:

- **winor30** can mute/unmute hosts and schedule downtimes (write operations we intentionally excluded)
- **ppandrangi** can CRUD monitors and dashboards (see above re: AI movies)
- **shelfio** has some unique metric field exploration tools

We sleep well at night.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>403 Forbidden</strong></summary>

1. Verify API key and Application key are correct
2. Check your Application Key has required [scopes](#application-key-scopes)
3. Confirm you're using the correct [regional endpoint](#regional-endpoints)
</details>

<summary><strong>Connection Issues</strong></summary>

```bash
# Check MCP server status
